**Premier League results predictor**
The aim of this project is to create an app that predicts the results for football matches in English Premier League.
First, the pl_data_scraper.py file is used to scrape all the results from the last two seasons (2021/22 and 2022/23). Then, we use machine learning based on some part of the results, so that we can predict the scores of remaining games and compare them to the actual ones.
